    "In this project, we will try to put ourselves into the shoes of content moderators. Every online platform which has an open forum faces an issue of people posting inappropriate comments, which if uncontrolled, can lead to loss of users, reputation and revenue. However, it is impractical and expensive for humans to keep track of all the messages other people post. Luckily, ML is here to help. We can train a model to automatically analyze all the messages users write and flag toxic users/comments so that appropriate actions can be taken.\n",

Both methods are used when there is only 1 right answer, e.g. an animal cannot be both a dog and a plane. In *multi-label* classification, each input can result in many possible answers, e.g. articles could have a mixture of tags: news, sports, politics."

    "So what are the implications for the neural network, that you are going to build? \n",
    "1. You cannot use softmax any more, since it makes a probability distribution over all of the classes. This time we need each output to have its own and independent probability. A good way to do it is to apply a Sigmoid activation to the output layer, which will squash your output between 0 and 1, thus you can treat the output as a probability to a sample belonging to a class\n",
    "2. We need to change our loss function. Cross-entropy loss is used for multi-class problems, so you will have to change it to Binary Cross-entropy since we want each output considered individually.\n",
    "3. Your labels will now have to be 1-hot-encoded. Since each output can have various labels, it is a good way to represent it. So a label, that belongs to class 1 and 4 out of possible 5, will be represented as `[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]`. You can use sklearn [one-hot-encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) to easily convert your labels\n",
    "4. When using model outputs (e.g. predictions in prod, evaluation), you will need to threshold the output. Why? Consider how a multi-label output with sigmoid activation from your model will look. For a 5 label problem, it will be a vector with 5 values, each from 0 to 1, e.g. `[0.01, 0.99, 0.68, 0.89, 0.32]`. How do you convert this into yes/no for each label? By applying a threshold of some value, such as 0.5. Meaning if the probability is less than 50%, we say it does not belong to this class. If more than 50% then it does, which will convert the above output to `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`"
